h1. Reloader

This is a painless boilerplate code to start designing Web sites in "Haml":http://haml-lang.com/, "Sass":http://sass-lang.com/ and "Compass":http://compass-style.org/. 

h2. Dependencies

You'd want to install the following dependencies to get the engines running.

@sudo gem install sinatra shotgun haml compass@

h2. Rollin' it

Open up Terminal and fire up @shotgun site.rb@. Browsers will now answer to every refresh with reloaded styles. Open up @views@ in your favorite text editor and you're ready to go.

That's all there is to it.

h2. Why?

This is supposed to be a helping tool during designing web pages. The files would probably be copied manually outside somewhere when finished.

I use this to design my websites before coding anything, helping me focus on design by just refreshing the page (like old-school HTML/CSS).
